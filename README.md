# Basic Programming Q&A

1. **What is a variable?**
   - A variable is like a container for storing data in a program.

2. **What does "if statement" do?**
   - An "if statement" helps a program make decisions by executing code only if a certain condition is true.

3. **What is a loop?**
   - A loop repeats a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met.

4. **What does "function" mean in programming?**
   - A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

5. **What is an array?**
   - An array is a collection of items stored in a single variable, accessed by an index number.

6. **What is a string?**
   - A string is a sequence of characters, like letters, numbers, and symbols, enclosed in quotation marks.

7. **What is a parameter?**
   - A parameter is a variable in a function definition that receives a value when the function is called.

8. **What does "return" do in a function?**
   - "Return" sends a value back to the caller of a function and stops the function's execution.

9. **What is an object?**
   - An object is a collection of properties (variables) and methods (functions) that represent a real-life entity in programming.

10. **What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?**
    - "==" checks for equality of value, while "===" checks for equality of both value and data type.

11. **What is a boolean?**
    - A boolean is a data type that can have one of two values: true or false.

12. **What is a comment?**
    - A comment is text in a program that is ignored by the compiler or interpreter, used to explain code to humans.

13. **What is concatenation?**
    - Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings together.

14. **What is an argument?**
    - An argument is a value passed to a function when it's called to fulfill a parameter.

15. **What is an operator?**
    - An operator performs an operation on one or more operands (variables or values) to produce a result.

16. **What is the difference between "break" and "continue" in a loop?**
    - "Break" stops the loop entirely, while "continue" stops the current iteration and moves to the next one.

17. **What does "console.log()" do?**
    - "console.log()" outputs data to the console for debugging or informational purposes.

18. **What is a method?**
    - A method is a function that is associated with an object and can be called on that object.

19. **What is the purpose of an index in an array?**
    - An index in an array is used to access and reference individual elements stored in the array.

20. **What is the difference between "var", "let", and "const" in JavaScript?**
    - "var" is function-scoped, "let" is block-scoped, and "const" is block-scoped and its value cannot be reassigned.
